# Stereo Vision Disparity Map and Depth Estimation
This repository contains a Python implementation for generating a disparity map from a pair of stereo images and estimating depth from the disparity map. The code uses OpenCV and NumPy for image processing and Matplotlib for visualization.
The main objective of this project is to generate a disparity map from a pair of stereo images and estimate the depth of the scene. The disparity map is created by comparing blocks of pixels from the left and right images. The depth estimation is then performed using the disparity values, focal length, and baseline distance.
